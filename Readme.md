### Explanation

This is a live document and will get updated as we go ahead with our research!



Please use this as a scratch book to write down all the ideas, questions and progress of our meetings/discussions.

 

Please upload any data, papers, code and etc. here and name the folders accordingly. Every time you upload something, please update this document so that we can trace back the work. Please use your initials and the date of the upload like below. This is not an English test so your grammar/choice of words are not important. If you feel like typing in Persian, that’s also fine by me.

I have uploaded some data from our latest sEEG patient. The data is 2 blocks of memory/speech task with 20 words (pseudo-word). Block2 dataset only contains 20 actual words (you can find a list of the words in `Data_Memory_Subject3_Block2_parameters.mat`). Block3 data set contains 10 words and 10 pseudo-word (list of words/pseudo-word can be found like Block2). The protocol we used is as follows:

 

The patient listened to an audio stimulation with 2 words (or non-words in the case of block3 data set) for 2 seconds. Then he had 2 seconds to memorize these words and then he had 2 seconds to speak the words (pseudoword). The test covered all the 20 words (and pseudoword) in the list for both blocks.



Repeat the following for all the words

| Visual cue Listen            | Visual cue Memorize | Visual cue Speak                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `2 sec`  (2 words presented) | `2 sec`             | `2 sec` (2  words spoken by the patient) |



We’re interested in:

1. figuring out the source localization characteristics of both words and non-words (and     hopefully see a difference!). 
2. Understand the differences in the way different vowels are processed in these regions.
3. Understand if the consonants have any impact on how the brain is processing this     information
4. Information transfer between regions. 
5. Any connectivity measures between the various regions.

 

I have also included some interesting papers if you’d like to have a read!
